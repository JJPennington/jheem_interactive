            <p>The JHEEM is a mathematical model of HIV transmission calibrated to US cities that generates local predictions of the HIV epidemic. In this application, we generate projections - under different scenarios of how the pandemic might affect sexual transmission, viral suppression, HIV testing, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use - to forecast possible effects of the pandemic on HIV transmission.</p>
