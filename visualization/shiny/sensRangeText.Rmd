__Warning__: In this web application of the sensitivity analysis, all the parameters are sampled uniformly from the range defined above. Lating Hypercube Sampling is used to allow meaningful results even with a small amount of samples. In the paper, different distribution were used depending on the variable of interest and thousands of samples were drawn. This means that the results shown by the app may differ from those presented in the paper.
